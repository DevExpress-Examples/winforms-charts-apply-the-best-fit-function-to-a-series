# How to Implement the Best Fit Function, and Apply it to a Chart's Series

This example shows how to perform a custom regression analysis against scatter series points generated from a data table and plot the line of best fit. 

![](images/line-of-best-fit.png)

To do so, follow the steps below:

- Create a point series (*Series 1* in this example) and [bind it to a data source](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/6561/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/provide-data/specify-series-data-members). This series' data is to be analyzed.

- Add a line series (*Line Of Best Fit*) that is used to display the Line of Best Fit.

- Create a method that uses a custom formula to perform the regression analysis against the first series' points. The method should calculate data points used to plot the line series.

- In the [ChartControl.BoundDataChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraCharts.ChartControl.BoundDataChanged?p=netframework) event handler, call the newly created method for the analyzed series (*Series 1*).

Note that you can also use built-in [Regression Lines](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/6231/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/series/indicators/simple-indicators/regression-lines?p=netframework).
